# Release Notes Directory

This directory contains detailed, user-friendly release notes for each version of Shadowbox.

## Structure

- **Individual Release Files**: `v{VERSION}.md` - Detailed release notes for each version
- **Template**: `template.md` - Template for creating new release notes
- **README**: This file explaining the structure

## Purpose

These release notes are designed for:
- **End Users**: Non-technical users who want to understand new features and improvements
- **GitHub Releases**: Content for GitHub release pages
- **Marketing**: Shareable content highlighting new features and benefits
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of changes and how to use new features

## Technical Changelog

For a technical, developer-focused changelog, see the main [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md) file in the project root.

## Creating New Release Notes

1. Copy `template.md` to `v{NEW_VERSION}.md`
2. Fill in the placeholders with actual content
3. Focus on user benefits and practical examples
4. Include migration notes if there are breaking changes
5. Add download instructions and technical details

## Best Practices

- **User-Focused**: Write for end users, not developers
- **Benefit-Oriented**: Explain what users gain from each change
- **Visual**: Use emojis and formatting to make content scannable
- **Complete**: Include installation, usage, and troubleshooting info
- **Consistent**: Follow the template structure for all releases

## Relationship to CHANGELOG.md

| Release Notes (this directory) | CHANGELOG.md |
|-------------------------------|--------------|
| User-friendly language | Technical language |
| Marketing focus | Developer focus |
| Rich formatting | Standardized format |
| Detailed explanations | Concise entries |
| Usage examples | Code changes |
| Benefits and outcomes | Features and fixes |

Both serve important but different purposes in the project documentation.
