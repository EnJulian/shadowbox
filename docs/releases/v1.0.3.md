# Shadowbox v1.0.3 Release Notes

##  Verbose Logging Control System

This release introduces a comprehensive verbose logging control system that significantly improves the user experience by providing cleaner, more manageable output.

###  New Features

#### **Verbose Logging Toggle**
- **New Settings Option**: Added option 6 in the Settings menu to toggle verbose logging
- **Persistent Setting**: Your verbose logging preference is saved and remembered between sessions
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy toggle through the enhanced settings menu

#### **Smart Output Control**
- **Clean Default Experience**: New users get minimal, clean output by default
- **Detailed Debug Mode**: Power users can enable verbose mode for troubleshooting
- **Selective Messaging**: Only essential messages (errors/warnings) show in non-verbose mode

###  Critical Bug Fixes

#### **Variable Naming Conflicts Resolved**
- **Fixed Runtime Errors**: Eliminated "cannot access local variable 'success'" errors
- **Function Call Conflicts**: Resolved conflicts between `success` variables and `success()` logging function
- **Comprehensive Renaming**: Updated all conflicting variables throughout the codebase
  - `success = download_audio(...)` → `download_success = download_audio(...)`
  - `success = apply_spotify_metadata_to_file(...)` → `metadata_success = apply_spotify_metadata_to_file(...)`
  - And many more systematic fixes

#### **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Consistent Error Messages**: Improved error message formatting and visibility
- **Fallback Protection**: Better handling when settings are not available
- **Always-Visible Critical Messages**: Errors and warnings always show regardless of verbose setting

###  Technical Improvements

#### **Logging Architecture Overhaul**
- **Controlled Verbose Output**: All verbose print statements now respect the logging setting
- **Download Command Visibility**: Detailed yt-dlp commands only show when verbose logging is enabled
- **Metadata Processing Control**: File processing messages controlled by verbose setting
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Improved logging system architecture

#### **Settings Menu Enhancement**
- **Expanded Options**: Settings menu now has 7 options (was 6)
- **Current Status Display**: Shows current verbose logging status in settings overview
- **Improved Layout**: Better organization and visual presentation
